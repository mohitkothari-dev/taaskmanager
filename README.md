# Task Scheduler + Drawing App
A small web-app which allows users to arrange sticky notes on a canvas.

### `Minimal feature-set`
A user should be able to:
* Add a sticky note anywhere on the screen. `done`
* Drag and drop a sticky note to a new location. `done`
* Delete a sticky note. `done`
* Set the text contained in a sticky note (either at creation or after). `done`
* Clear the canvas of all sticky notes. `done` 

### `Bonus features`
*  Drawing: Add ability to draw anywhere on the canvas `done`
* (super bonus if you add ability to erase) `done`
* Images: Add ability to upload images to the canvas. `done`

### `Mega Bonus features`
* Collaboration: Share the link of the canvas with a peer. Both peers can edit the same canvas in real-time. `done` **separately on localhost can't host it online**
* Persistence: Persist the state of the board when it is modified and restore it when the user opens the same link again. `done`
